# HackCMU-2020
This is a Discord bot created for HackCMU 2020 by Adhvik Kanagala and Keren Huang. 
Functionality is somewhat limited but it was a great exercise of our somewhat limited knowledge of Python, as well as our skills with accessing APIs. 
In the future, we'd like to figure out how to implement OAuth2 to allow for deeper integration with various services, which was the biggest hurdle of this project.
For now, the bot has a few commands, which can be accessed using !commands.
